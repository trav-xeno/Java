# Java
This repo will link to a bunch of Java projects, Which I will add as times goes on.<br />
Also just a general notice, but as of 2019 Java is free for personal/educational use only.<br /> If you use Java in anything buisness related you will have to pay Oracle.<br />
Just had to say that to cover myself. I think it is kind of dumb to have it change this way after so long of free use, but anyways there are plenty of other options out there. <br /> For web stuff just use Scala, Rust, kotlin, C#, Go, Python, Javascript/Typescript(node/deno), nim, and any other language that fits your needs.
